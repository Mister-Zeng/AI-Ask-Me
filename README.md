## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Enter the prompt to ask the artificial intelligence what to do
- Create each a container that display the entered prompt and response 
- Container should be displayed in the order from new to old
- Able to delete the container

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Semantic UI
- React.js
- Node.js
- Fetching, Storing, Deleting API locally

### What I learned

This app is completed on 5/14/2022. I started learning React just a couple week before I made this app. I decided that instead of making a static site with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I will take this opportunity to test my skill on what I have learned so far with React. It was a little challenging for me, but I was able to learn the different tools onhand and translate it into this project. I was able to implement function component along with useState. Fetching api, stored it and rendered it into the element. Each container that was being displayed is added on as a new element and able to delete them as well. 

### Continued development

In my continued development, I want to dive deeper into learning better on creating react component indivdually. I acknowldge that I am still having a little trouble with it, but in time, I know I will understand it. 

### How to run this app. 

In this repository, it contains a .env.example file. Create a .env file. In the .env.example file, it contain information format on how your .env file should look like. You need to enter your api key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) in order to fetch the data to run this app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
